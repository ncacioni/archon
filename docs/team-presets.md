# USDAF — Team Presets

> Project-specific agent team configurations. Used by Agent 00 (Orchestrator) during Phase 0 (Kickoff).

---

## How Team Selection Works

1. User describes their project scope
2. Orchestrator (00) recommends a preset based on project type
3. User confirms or customizes the team
4. Team roster is saved to `backlog/config.yml`
5. Only active team agents participate in the project

---

## Core Team (Always Active)

These agents are **mandatory for every project**, regardless of preset:

| # | Agent | Why |
|---|-------|-----|
| 00 | Orchestrator | Coordinates all phases and agents |
| 08 | Security Architect | Veto power, security-by-design is non-negotiable |
| 27 | Spec Writer | Spec-driven development is the foundation of USDAF |
| 28 | Backlog Manager | Task lifecycle tracking is non-negotiable |

## Custom Team Configuration

Users can always customize by adding/removing agents:

```
Orchestrator: "I recommend the Full Stack App preset for this project.
This includes 18 mandatory agents. Would you like to:
1. Use this preset as-is
2. Add agents from the recommended list
3. Start from scratch and pick individual agents
4. Use a different preset

Which agents from the recommended list would you like to add?"
```

## Team Roster in config.yml

```yaml
team:
  core: [00, 08, 27, 28]           # Always active
  active: [00, 01, 02, 04, ...]    # Full active team for this project
  preset: full-stack-app             # Which preset was used
  customizations:                    # Any additions/removals from preset
