# Archon — Unified Spec-Driven Agile Framework v1.0

> **No code is written until specs exist and are approved. Specs are the source of truth.**

## Overview

Archon merges the Multi-Agent Framework (25 agents, 7 phases, security gates) with spec-driven development and Backlog.md-style markdown-native task management into a single unified framework. Every development project passes through required phases with a project-specific agent team.

### Core Principles

1. **Spec-First**: Formal specifications (OpenAPI, DB schema, wireframes, event contracts) are produced and approved BEFORE any implementation begins
2. **Phase-Gated**: 8 phases (0-7) with explicit gates; no phase proceeds without gate approval
3. **Team-Based**: Each project selects its agent team at kickoff — mandatory core + optional specialists
4. **Backlog-Driven**: All work tracked as markdown task files in `backlog/` directory, git-versioned
5. **Security Veto**: Agent 08 (Security Architect) retains veto power at any phase
6. **Backward Compatible**: Existing Prompts A-D continue to work unchanged

## Phase System (8 Phases + Continuous)

### Phase 0: PROJECT KICKOFF

**Purpose**: Initialize project, select team, create backlog structure.

**Activities**:
1. User describes project scope and goals
2. Orchestrator (00) presents team presets (see `team-presets.md`)
3. User selects/customizes agent team
4. Backlog Manager (28) initializes `backlog/` directory structure
5. Product Owner (26) creates initial epic backlog from project scope

**Gate G-1**: Team confirmed, `backlog/config.yml` created, initial epics logged.

**Artifacts**:
- `backlog/config.yml` — Project configuration
- `backlog/tasks/` — Initial epic task files
- Team roster document

---

### Phase 1: DISCOVERY & SPECS

**Purpose**: Elicit requirements, map compliance, produce formal specifications.

**Activities**:
1. Requirements Architect (02) elicits FR/NFR, acceptance criteria
2. Compliance (03) maps regulatory requirements
3. UX Researcher (32) produces personas and journey maps (if on team)
4. **Spec Writer (27) produces ALL specifications** (see Spec Types below)
5. Product Owner (26) breaks specs into epics → stories → tasks in backlog
6. Architecture Board (01) reviews spec completeness

**Gate G0**: All specs approved, backlog populated with stories, compliance matrix complete.

**Spec Types Produced**:

| Spec | Format | File |
|------|--------|------|
| API Specification | OpenAPI 3.1 YAML | `specs/openapi.yaml` |
| WebSocket Events | AsyncAPI / JSON | `specs/ws-events.json` |
| Database Schema | SQL + ERD (Mermaid) | `specs/db-schema.sql`, `specs/erd.md` |
| Domain Model | Mermaid class diagram | `specs/domain-model.md` |
| UI Wireframes | Markdown + Mermaid | `specs/wireframes.md` |
| State Machines | Mermaid stateDiagram | `specs/state-machines.md` |
| Environment Config | YAML template | `specs/env-template.yaml` |
| Test Plan | Markdown | `specs/test-plan.md` |

---

### Phase 2: ARCHITECTURE

**Purpose**: Define solution architecture validated against specs.

**Activities**:
1. Enterprise Architect (04): Solution architecture, C4 diagrams, tech stack
2. Data Architect (05): Domain model, ERD validated against `specs/db-schema.sql`
3. Integration Architect (06): API contracts validated against `specs/openapi.yaml`
4. Infrastructure Architect (07): IaC, networking, container strategy
5. Data Engineer (33): Migration strategy, pipeline design (if on team)

**Gate G1**: Architecture Board approval, architecture consistent with specs.

---

### Phase 3: SECURITY

**Purpose**: Threat modeling, security architecture, controls matrix.

**Activities**:
1. Security Architect (08): STRIDE threat model, controls matrix
2. IAM Agent (09): AuthN/AuthZ design, OAuth 2.1/OIDC flows
3. Secrets & Crypto (10): Encryption plan, vault strategy
4. Threat Intelligence (11): Abuse cases, OWASP validation

**Gate G2**: Security Architect approval. **VETO POWER** — unresolved critical risks block all progress.

---

### Phase 4: IMPLEMENTATION (Sprint-Driven)

**Purpose**: Build the system in sprints, validated against specs.

**Sprint Structure** (managed by Backlog Manager 28):
1. Sprint Planning: Pull stories from backlog, assign to agents
2. Implementation: Domain (12) → App (13) → Adapters (14) → Frontend (15/16)
3. Sprint Review: Demo completed work against specs
4. Retrospective: Process improvements

**Validation Rule**: Every implemented endpoint/component MUST reference its spec. Code that doesn't match specs is rejected.

**Gate G3**: Code review (19) passes, all implemented items match specs.

---

### Phase 5: QUALITY ASSURANCE

**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing and security scanning.

**Activities**:
1. Test Architect (17): Test strategy mapped to specs
2. Test Implementation (18): Unit/integration/E2E tests per test plan
3. SAST (20): OWASP Top 10 scan, CVE detection
4. Performance Engineer (31): Load tests, SLA validation (if on team)

**Gate G4**: Tests pass (90%+ domain coverage), SAST clean (no CVSS >= 9.0), performance SLAs met.

---

### Phase 6: OPERATIONS

**Purpose**: Pipeline, observability, documentation, release preparation.

**Activities**:
1. CI/CD (21): Pipeline with security gates, Docker builds
2. Observability (22): Structured logging, metrics, tracing
3. Documentation (23): API docs, runbooks, README
4. DevEx Engineer (30): Onboarding guide, local dev setup (if on team)
5. Release Manager (29): Changelog, release notes, versioning (if on team)

**Gate G5**: Pipeline green, docs complete, release notes ready.

---

### Phase 7: GOVERNANCE & LAUNCH

**Purpose**: Final review and deployment.

**Activities**:
1. Architecture Board (01): Final compliance review
2. Product Owner (26): Acceptance sign-off
3. Release Manager (29): Deployment coordination
4. Backlog Manager (28): Sprint closure, retrospective

**Artifacts**: Release notes, deployment record, retrospective summary.

### Continuous Activities (Throughout All Phases)

| Activity | Agent | Frequency |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Backlog grooming | 28 - Backlog Manager | Weekly |
| Sprint ceremonies | 28 - Backlog Manager | Per sprint cycle |
| Security monitoring | 08 - Security Architect | Continuous (veto anytime) |
| Spec evolution | 27 - Spec Writer | As requirements change |
| Innovation watch | 25 - Innovation Scout | Monthly |

## Spec-Driven Workflow

### Spec Lifecycle

```
Draft → Review (team) → Approved → Locked (implementation starts)
                                       ↓
                              Change Request → Re-review → Approved v2
```

### Rules

1. **No implementation without a spec**: Every endpoint, table, component, and event MUST have a spec before code is written
2. **Spec versioning**: Specs are versioned (v1, v2) — changes after lock require a Change Request
3. **Spec-to-backlog**: Each spec section generates backlog items automatically:
   - OpenAPI endpoints → one task per endpoint group
   - DB tables → one task per migration
   - UI wireframes → one task per screen/component
4. **Spec validation**: In Gate G3, implementation is validated against specs (contract testing)

### Spec Templates

See `Arch standard/spec-templates.md` for complete templates for each spec type.

## Project Team Configuration

### Core Team (Mandatory for ALL Projects)

| # | Agent | Why Mandatory |
|---|-------|--------------|
| 00 | Orchestrator | Coordinates everything |
| 08 | Security Architect | Veto power, security-by-design |
| 27 | Spec Writer | Specs are non-negotiable |
| 28 | Backlog Manager | Task tracking is non-negotiable |

### Team Presets

See `Arch standard/team-presets.md` for complete preset definitions.

### Team Selection Flow

```
User describes project
    ↓
Orchestrator (00) analyzes scope
    ↓
Presents matching preset(s) + recommendation
    ↓
User confirms or customizes team
    ↓
Team roster saved to backlog/config.yml
```
